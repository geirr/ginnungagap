dist_ptr:
	* support rmi for local objects in migrationg state (will be possible when we forward rmis at once)

MigrationGroup:
	* Check that removing objects from deactiveted group (in migrating state) works
	* Check changeGroup for bugs

Migration:
	* Forward RMI messages while objects are in migrating state
	* Send a mininit(?) message to the new host first, and make it allocate
	  the new objects, then send (just the changed?) data from the original objects

Object:
	* Devide Object into identifiable, remote, movable? Or something similar...
