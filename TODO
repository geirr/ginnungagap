dist_ptr:
	* support RMI for local objects in migrating state (will be possible when we forward RMIs at once)

MigrationGroup:
	* Check that removing objects from deactivated group (in migrating state) works
	* Check changeGroup for bugs

Migration:
	* Forward RMI messages while objects are in migrating state
	* Send a miginit(?) message to the new host first, and make it allocate
	  the new objects, then send (just the changed?) data from the original objects

Object:
	* Divide Object into two or three objects: identifiable, remote, movable? Or something similar...

Code enhancements:
	* Remove the ugly pointers:
		- STL containers with pointers are not good
		- Change the xdr buffer pointers to Boost::shared_ptr?
	* Introduce exceptions
		- Socket reads/writes
		- Buffer reads/writes
