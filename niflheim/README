** NIFLHEIM **
**************

Niflheim is a sample application built using the
Ginnungagap middleware. It simulates a very
simple mmog, where a world object resides on
the server, and the clients connect and get an
avatar each. The client comes in two versions,
one where the client moves the avatar at random,
and one where the avatar can be controlled with
the keyboard.

********************
* RUNNING NIFLHEIM *
********************

Niflheim consists of four different binaries:
server, proxy, client and mclient.

You will need to run one instance of the server.
This is the machine the clients will connect to at
first. Then you can run any number of proxies,
usually 0-5, and any number of any version of
the client.

The concept is of course that you at least runs
some proxies, so the middleware will be able to
relocate the world and avatars to the server or
proxy which is closest to the center of the clients.


**********
* SERVER *
**********

Usage:

	server <local IP>:<wanted listening port> <core-node selection threshold in ms> <core-node selection interval in seconds>

Example:

	server 197.234.221.4:6767 10 120

*********
* PROXY *
*********

Usage:

	proxy <local IP>:<wanted listening port> <server IP>:<server port> <core-node selection threshold in ms> <core-node selection interval in seconds>

Example:

	proxy 223.114.98.34:6767 197.234.221.4:6767 10 120

**********
* CLIENT *
**********

Usage:

	client <local IP>:<wanted listening port> <server IP>:<server port> <number of times to move the avatar>

Example:

	client 198.192.63.111:6666 197.234.221.4:6767 500

*****************
* MANUAL CLIENT *
*****************

Usage:

	mclient <local IP>:<wanted listening port> <server IP>:<server port>

Example:

	mclient 198.192.63.111:6666 197.234.221.4:6767

***********************************
* GINNUNGAGAP PERFORMANCE TESTING *
***********************************

In the niflheim/src/test folder, you
can find the code for the servers and clients
used for testing the performance of 
ginnungagap. These are kind of badly
documented, so if you really want to know
more about these, you should probably
contact me.
