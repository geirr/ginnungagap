** GINNUNGAGAP **
*****************

Ginnungagap(*) is a middleware written in C++ which 
supports RMI, migration of objects, grouping
of objects, and core-node selection. It includes basic
server functionality. An test application, named
Niflheim, which uses Ginnungagap, is included.

*******************************
* THE IDEA BEHIND GINNUNGAGAP *
*******************************

With this middleware it is possible to group the
objects used by one or more clients. With core-node
selection algorithms, one can search for nodes that
are better physically placed than the current one.
Since our middleware supports migration, it is then
possible to move the entire group of objects to the
new, better placed server (transparently during
run-time). This way we can lower the aggregate latency
from the clients to the objects they need.

*******************************
* OVERVIEW OF THE SOURCE CODE *
*******************************

lib/ginnungagap:
	This is the main middleware source code

niflheim:
	This is the test application source code

niflheim/src/ggg:
    This folder contains the test application's bindings to the middleware


*************
* COMPILING *
*************

Just run the compile.sh script, and the middleware
and test application will be built in a directory
called `build'. All the binaries can then be found
in the directory:

build/niflheim/src

* NEEDED TOOLS/LIBRARIES *
**************************

* CMake
* e2fsprogs libraries (for uuidgen)
* GNU c library (for xdr)
* Boost::Graph

To install these on a debian/ubuntu compatible system, use the
following command:

sudo apt-get install libc-dev uuid-dev cmake libboost-graph-dev

* NOTE *
********

Since I didn't know C++ when I started this project (my
background is from C), some of the old code is quite ugly,
and not in the spirit of C++. Please see the TODO file
for some of the most important code changes that need to
be done.



* Ginnungagap: A term from Old Norse mythology, Ginnungagap is
what exists before the world is created; it is envisioned as an
enormously wide gap, filled with energies but lacking form or order.
